		<p><strong>Feature engineering</strong> is one of the most important — and often overlooked — steps in any machine learning (ML) pipeline. It involves transforming raw data into meaningful features that help a model learn patterns and make predictions.</p>

		<p>While it’s tempting to obsess over choosing the “right” model — <em>Random Forest vs. Neural Networks</em>, for instance — it’s usually the <strong>quality of your features</strong> that drives performance. This is also where <strong>geological knowledge has the biggest impact</strong>: translating concepts we intuitively grasp — like structural controls or fluid pathways — into numerical inputs a machine can actually learn from.</p>

		<p>Geologists are trained to “see” patterns in maps — this is built from experience and spatial reasoning. But ML models can’t see — they need numbers. Our intuition must be encoded as structured data.</p>

	  <h2>Know Your Data — Scientifically</h2>
	  <p>Don’t just rely on “data availability.” Understand what each dataset <em>actually</em> measures:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>What is the spatial resolution?</li>
		<li>What are the sampling biases?</li>
		<li>Is it a direct or indirect measure of your target variable?</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>These are basic research design questions — but they’re often overlooked in geoscience ML workflows. Apply the same scientific scrutiny to feature design as you would to field sampling.</p>

		<h2>Concept → Proxy → Dataset</h2>

		<p>At its core, feature engineering starts with a <strong>concept</strong> — a geological process or control, like <em>“enhanced permeability”</em> or <em>“magmatic heat source.”</em></p>

		<p>Next, you choose a <strong>proxy</strong> to represent that concept numerically — for example, <em>distance to fault</em> or <em>proximity to intrusion</em>.</p>

		<p>Finally, that proxy comes from a <strong>dataset</strong> — such as fault line shapefiles or gridded geophysical surveys.</p>

		<p>While inspiration often starts with a concept and works toward the data, the reverse is also true. A dataset might spark an idea: a new gravity survey or alteration product might serve as a proxy for a geologic process. This makes feature engineering a creative, two-way dialogue between geology and data.</p>

	  <h2>Use the Mineral Systems Framework</h2>

	  <p>The <em>Mineral Systems Approach</em> provides a structured way to generate features:</p>

	  <p>For each key process (e.g., energy, fluids, structure, traps, preservation), ask:</p>

	  <ul>
		<li>What <strong>concept</strong> matters?</li>
		<li>What <strong>proxy</strong> can represent that concept?</li>
		<li>What <strong>dataset</strong> can provide that proxy?</li>
	  </ul>

		<h2>Resolution Matters</h2>

		<p>A key decision in geoscience ML is whether to use <strong>regression</strong> or <strong>classification</strong> — and <strong>data resolution</strong> helps guide that choice:</p>

		<ul>
		  <li><strong>Regression</strong> predicts <em>continuous</em> values — like grade or depth.</li>
		  <li><strong>Classification</strong> predicts <em>categories</em> — like deposit types or prospectivity zones.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>When your data has <strong>high spatial resolution</strong> (e.g., geophysics, dense geochemistry), you can model spatial variation more precisely — making regression models ideal.</p>

		<p>But <strong>low-resolution or categorical data</strong> (e.g., lithological units or coarse geology maps) may be better suited for classification. These datasets don't support fine-grained predictions — but can still group or label based on broader patterns.</p>

		<p>Always ask: <em>What is this dataset really measuring? What is its spatial granularity?</em></p>
